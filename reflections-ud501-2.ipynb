The broker needs to know whether to buy or sell and of\nwhich stock(s) by their market symbols. The order must also contain the number of shares\nand the type of order. Stock exchanges only consider limit orders and market orders, but\nnote that orders can be increasingly complex based on instructions given to a broker. A\nmarket order is an order at the current market price, and ordering at a limit price tells the\nbroker to only buy or sell at a certain price; for example, some may not want to buy beyond\nsome value or sell below some price. Of course, a limit order must also include the desired\nprice.\n\nAfter the broker sends the order to the stock exchange, it is made public in the style\nof an \u00e2\u0080\u009dorder book\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Others can see the stocks and collective bids that have been made on\nthem, but not who has placed the orders. The order book contains a list for each stock of\nthe orders within it including whether the order asks for others to buy or bids on the stock.\nBoth types include a price at which orders are allowed to be bought/sold at and the size of\nthe order. Orders of the same type and price are lumped together. Market orders always\nsell at the highest bid and buy at the lowest asking price.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Dynamics of Exchange\n\nThere are many stock exchanges, and each has its own order book. When an order is placed,\nsay by an individual, the order is sent to the broker and the broker chooses between the\nstock exchanges to execute that order. The broker takes information from all the stock\nexchanges and makes a transaction based on which one has the stock with the best price.\nFees are associated with making transactions in stock exchanges and with using a broker. A\nbroker typically has many clients; the broker can observe clients who want to buy and sell\nat the same price and circumvent stock exchanges entirely. The law ensures that this trade\ncan only happen if both the buyer and seller get prices that are at least as good as at an\nexchange. Even if this transaction cuts out the stock exchange, it must still be registered\nwith one, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually with the exchange the stock is housed.\n\nOrders can be handled internally or moved through what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ddark pool\u00e2\u0080\u009d. A dark\npool is a place where investors can trade without the transparency of an order book outside\nof a stock exchange. The results of the trade, like internal trades, still need to be registered\nwith public exchanges after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve occured. A dark pool can act as an intermediary between\nall types of investors that may want to escape the transparency of stock exchanges.\nBrokers like this because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay fees associated with trading at a stock\nexchange. They also argue that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair because clients are getting prices that are as good\nas at the market. However, hedge funds and dark pools can heavily exploit this system as\nit stands if they have well-placed, fast computers.\n\nExploiting the Market\n\nThese days the market is entirely digital and computers automate transactions all across\nthe country. As a result, orders can be processed in fractions of a second, and timing is\neverything. A hedge fund may pay stock exchanges enough money to house computers very\nclose to the exchanges, which gives them a distinct advantage. For example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say that\nsomeone places an order for a stock, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sent to multiple markets. A hedge fund close\nto those markets can see that order reach one of them first and buy up that stock from the\nother exchanges through the high speed infrastructure they have in place. Then when that\norder reaches other exchanges, the hedge fund has already bought those shares and sells it\nback at a higher price. This is one of many strategies in High Frequency Trading (HFT)\nthat takes place on the order of milliseconds.\n\nThis can also happen on an international scale. A hedge fund may have computers collocated\nwith international markets rapidly observing and comparing order books between\nthem. If a difference occurs in a stock between the two markets, all that needs to be done\nis to sell in the market with a higher price and buy in the market with a lower one. This\nhappens very quickly, so the price of the stock is not very different at different markets.\nHFT strategies usually trade high volumes to turn a large profit in small price differences.\n\nThose that operate on HFT strategies can not only manipulate a transparent market,\nbut also a dark one. First, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explain why someone would want to use a dark pool. For\nexample, an investor who wants to sell a high volume of shares in a transparent market\nwould want to do so in small chunks so as not to upset the price all at once and get less for\nthe shares. However, others will see this and lower their bids knowing that a high volume\n33 is to be sold and the investor still gets less for their shares. In a dark pool, others can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see\nthose that want to buy or sell, so the investor may get a better price. There are many ways\nto exploit a dark pool, but it always stems from information leakage. Knowing the order\nbook of a dark pool means a world of advantage. Dark pool operators or constituents may\nsecretly participate in their own pool or leak information about it to others for a price. The\nprivate nature of a dark pool allows those who operate it to make their own rules about\nwho can participate and how trading works. Since information is at the discretion of the\noperator, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fairly easy for those with direct access to exploit a dark pool. Those that\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have direct access can \u00e2\u0080\u009dgame\u00e2\u0080\u009d the pool by probing it with many small volume orders.\nThis yields some idea of the size and prices of bids, which gamers can exploit by selling\nwhen they find the bids are highest and buying when asking is lowest.\n\nOther Orders and Shorting\n\nAlthough exchanges only take market and limit orders, other orders can be made through\na broker. Often a broker implements them for clients without their knowledge to benefit\nboth themselves and the client. The most simple order above a limit order is a stop-loss\norder. The broker holds stock until the price drops below a certain price, then sells at\nmarket price. Similarly, a stop-gain order waits until the price climbs to a point at which\nthe client wants to sell. Slightly more complex is the trailing stop. Here the broker sets a\nstop-loss criteria trailing a stock that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing in price. As the price increases, so does\nthe stop-loss criteria; when that stock starts to decrease, the stop-loss criteria is met and\nstocks are sold.\n\nWhat if someone wanted to bet that a stock will decrease and still profit? Instead of just\nselling high and buying low, those stocks can be borrowed and sold, so the value of those\nstocks is gained at a high point but the stocks are still owed. Then when the price of the\nstock decreases, the stock can be bought at a lower value, and the shares returned to whom\nthey were borrowed while a profit on the difference was made. This is called shorting. As\nlong as the price of the stock goes down, this is a good strategy; however, if the price goes\nup, then the difference results in a net loss."}, {"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 02-03 What is a company worth?"}, {"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Net worth** is the value of all the non-financial and financial assets owned by an institutional unit or sector less the value of all its outstanding liabilities.

The trouble is that diversification still doesn't solve the problem of systematic risk; even a portfolio of all the shares in the stock market can't eliminate that risk.

However, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) can be categorized into three basic levels:\n\n- **Weak-Form EMH**\n\nThe weak-form EMH implies that the market is efficient, reflecting all market information. This hypothesis assumes that the rates of return on the market should be independent; past rates of return have no effect on future rates. Given this assumption, rules such as the ones traders use to buy or sell a stock, are invalid.\n\n- **Semi-Strong EMH**\n\nThe semi-strong form EMH implies that the market is efficient, reflecting all publicly available information. This hypothesis assumes that stocks adjust quickly to absorb new information. The semi-strong form EMH also incorporates the weak-form hypothesis. Given the assumption that stock prices reflect all new available information and investors purchase stocks after this information is released, an investor cannot benefit over and above the market by trading on new information.\n\n- **Strong-Form EMH**\n\nThe strong-form EMH implies that the market is efficient: it reflects all information both public and private, building and incorporating the weak-form EMH and the semi-strong form EMH. Given the assumption that stock prices reflect all information (public as well as private) no investor would be able to profit above the average investor even if he was given new information."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Weak Form Tests\n\nThe tests of the weak form of the EMH can be categorized as:\n\nStatistical Tests for Independence - In our discussion on the weak-form EMH, we stated that the weak-form EMH assumes that the rates of return on the market are independent. Given that assumption, the tests used to examine the weak form of the EMH test for the independence assumption. Examples of these tests are the autocorrelation tests (returns are not significantly correlated over time) and runs tests (stock price changes are independent over time).\n\nTrading Tests - Another point we discussed regarding the weak-form EMH is that past returns are not indicative of future results, therefore, the rules that traders follow are invalid. An example of a trading test would be the filter rule, which shows that after transaction costs, an investor cannot earn an abnormal return.\n\nSemi-strong Form Tests\n\nGiven that the semi-strong form implies that the market is reflective of all publicly available information, the tests of the semi-strong form of the EMH are as follows:\n\nEvent Tests - The semi-strong form assumes that the market is reflective of all publicly available information. An event test analyzes the security both before and after an event, such as earnings. The idea behind the event test is that an investor will not be able to reap an above average return by trading on an event.\n\nRegression/Time Series Tests - Remember that a time series forecasts returns based historical data. As a result, an investor should not be able to achieve an abnormal return using this method.\n\nStrong-Form Tests\n\nGiven that the strong-form implies that the market is reflective of all information, both public and private, the tests for the strong-form center around groups of investors with excess information. These investors are as follows:\n\nInsiders - Insiders to a company, such as senior managers, have access to inside information. SEC regulations forbid insiders for using this information to achieve abnormal returns.\n\nExchange Specialists - An exchange specialist recalls runs on the orders for a specific equity. It has been found however, that exchange specialists can achieve above average returns with this specific order information.\n\nAnalysts - The equity analyst has been an interesting test. It analyzes whether an analyst's opinion can help an investor achieve above average returns. Analysts do typically cause movements in the equities they focus on.\n\nInstitutional money managers - Institutional money managers, working for mutual funds, pensions and other types of institutional accounts, have been found to have typically not perform above the overall market benchmark on a consistent basis."}, {"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 02-09 The Fundamental Law of active portfolio management"}, {"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Richard Grinold was trying to find a way of relating performance, skill, and breadth.
